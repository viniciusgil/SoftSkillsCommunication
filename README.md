# SoftSkillsCommunication
In this Aramco Project my role as a junior game developer, I had the chance to work on a VR commercial project with a client provided by a game development bootcamp course. Using the Unity Engine, I was able to create a prototype of Soft Skills training which was presented to hundreds of investors in Saudi Arabia.

On the coding side, I wrote scripts for the game prototype in C#, and developed UI elements,
for the buttons I added audio and functionalities, for all conversations for both languages
(English and Arabic), and audio too, for every text and audio, I had to implement
localization. The hands interactions with the UI and scenes, teleportation, etc... Make the
3D animations work in the scenes.
The client requested a system of answers like a quiz, with specification points for the correct answers.

I also served as the communication leader, managing the expectations of the client, keeping
them informed on our progress, and scheduling meetings. This was a valuable experience
that allowed me to further develop my skills in game development and gain a better
understanding of the industry.

Furthermore, I took the initiative to learn new technologies and techniques to improve the
game's design and keep up with industry standards.
